"""
A group of five students enrolls in Statistics immediately after taking a Math aptitude test. 
Each student's Math aptitude test score, x, and Statistics course grade, y, can be expressed as the following list of (x, y) points:

    95 85
    85 95
    80 70
    70 65
    60 70

If a student scored an 80 on the Math aptitude test, what grade would we expect them to achieve in Statistics? 
Determine the equation of the best-fit line using the least squares method, then compute and print the value of y when x=80.
